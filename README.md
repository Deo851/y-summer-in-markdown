# My Summer 2024 -- Deonardo

## Introduction

Hi, my name is Deonardo Gallegos  and Im in 11th grade. I love to watch lots of sports like football, baseball, and basketball. I like to go fishing, play video games, and play sports in my freetime.

## Summer Activities

<ul>
  <li>One place I visited during the summer was my trip to Laughlin, Arizona. There I went to Lake Mohave to ride jet skis, The Lake felt so nice because of the crazy temperature it was in Arizona.</li>
  <li>I also went to dodger stadium. My dad was able to get some tickets that went for 1,000 dollars because he knows one of the baseball players from his job. They brang us food for free and the food was great, they had tri tip steak with barbeque and it was the best. During that night the dodgers won and hit four homeruns, it was a blast that game</li>
  <li>I went on a boat to go deep sea fishing near catalina island and I was able to catch two bass and a barecuda which we latter brought home with us to cook. The fish was fresh so it even tasted better then usual.</li>
</ul>

## New Skills I Learned

During some of my trips when I went camping I learned how to start a fire without anything but just some sticks and the help of a knife. I also learned some construction work when we were extending our driveway and building my room.

## Goals for the school year
<ul>
<li>I want to pass all my classes with a B or higher</li>
<li>I hope to be able to learn piano really well during this year in piano class</li>
<li>And I hope to make new friends during this year</li>
</ul>

## Expectations for this class

Some expectations I have in this class is that it won't be easy due to the amount of coding we will have to do but I hope it can be a fun and memorable experience for me in the future.
